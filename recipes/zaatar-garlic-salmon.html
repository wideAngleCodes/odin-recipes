    <h1>Zaatar Garlic Salmon</h1>
    <img src="images/zaatar_garlic_salmon.jpg">
    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Zaatar is a versatile spice mix consisting of a ground wild mountain herb reminiscent of thyme or oregano, toasted sesame seeds and sumac, a spice made from sour berries. Other spices may be added too, but these three spices are what makes the spice mix.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons people rave so much about zaatar, is its versatility. It goes well with just about anything. Try it on your breakfast eggs, with roast vegetables or pulses, with chicken or on bread.</p>
    <p>And, of course, salmon!</p>


    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><h4>For 2 servings:</h4></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb salmon fillet, no skin</li>
            <li>2 lemons</li>
            <li>24 baby potatoes (about 24 oz), scrubbed</li>
            <li>4 cup grape tomatoes (about 20 oz), halved if you like</li>
            <li>12 oz broccoli florets</li>
            <li>6 tbsp fresh minced garlic (about 10 to 12 cloves)</li>
            <li>Quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>4 tsp Za'atar spice</li>
            <li>2 tsp coriander</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add the potatoes, grape tomatoes, and broccoli. Pour 2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and toss. Then, add a little salt and pepper, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1 teaspoon za'atar spice, Â½ teaspoon coriander. Toss again so that the spices are distributed to coat the vegetables. Transfer the vegetables to a large baking sheet with a rim.</li>
                <li>Pat salmon dry. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle just a little extra virgin olive oil. Spread the remaining garlic evenly on top. Sprinkle the remaining zaatar and coriander.</li>
                <li>Cut seasoned salmon into 4 equal pieces, and place on the prepared baking sheet with the vegetables. Add another generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over the salmon and veggies, if needed.</li>
                <li>Bake in heated oven for 15-16 minutes. Remove from heat and squeeze lemon juice on salmon. Sprinkle more za'atar all over. Enjoy with Lebanese rice and a side of your favorite salad.</li>
